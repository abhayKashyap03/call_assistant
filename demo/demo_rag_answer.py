Demo script for RAG answer method with Gemini integration.

This script demonstrates the complete workflow:
1. Retrieve top-K chunks using Search-R1 algorithm
2. Build prompt with system persona and citations
3. Call Gemini API with context and query
4. Return answer, confidence score, and sources list

Usage:
    python demo_rag_answer.py

Requirements:
    - Set GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable for full functionality
    - Or run without API key to see fallback behavior

            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. 
            Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,

            scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple,

            maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity 
            and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available

            Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems 
            the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly

            access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with 
            observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order 
            to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the 
            examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically

            Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework

            provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application
